									<h2>ABOUT ME<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>Hello, my name is Nurul Ika Syafiny Binti Azhar. I am from Melaka. I am
										currently studying at UTM, Skudai, Johor in Bachelor of Computer Science(Data Engineering) and on my first year. 
										 I decided to pursue my studies in computer science because of
										my interest in it and some skills I had developed in coding. I had my high school education at SMKA Sharifah Rodziah and succeed in getting
										9A in SPM. In my high school years, I had participated in few coding competition like Hackathon and The Hour of Code. Before my degree, 
										I had my foundation at UiTM Dengkil for one year and passed with CGPA 4.0. I am experienced in C and C++ programming language. Besides
										programming, I also knowledgable in the use of Microsoft Word, Google Docs, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Microsoft Power
										Point and Canva. Furthermore, I know how to edit videos using Capcut. My hobby is drawing. I love to draw on my free times
										and do other crafting activities such as crocheting. 
										
										Other than that, I have good social skills because of my participation in college students council and had become crews 
										for many college and university program. This shows that I can work in teams and can cooperate well with my teammates.
										Last but not least, I am excited to learn new things and ready to take on challenges that will come along the years of my study.

										I had created this poster using Canva. I learned how to create poster from simple template and add up interesting
										elements in it such as wavy textbox, eye-catching fonts that are also easy to read at the same time and use proper 
										colour to make my poster pop-out and not too crowded so the reader can read the content of my poster with ease. Other 
										than that, I also learned how to sum up a long talk into simple sentences and paragraph that are easy to understand
										and easy to understand.
